          Extreme floods in large river basins such as the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) can have significant regional and global socioeconomic impacts. These floods are often caused by sequences of extreme storms rather than a single event, due to the basin's large water storage capacity and complex river network. However, the interactions between extreme storm sequences and resulting floods, as well as their changes in a warming climate, remain poorly understood. Here we combine a novel stochastic rainfall generator (StormLab) with a large-scale hydrologic model (the Hillslope Link Model) to simulate 10,000 realizations of winter-spring flood scenarios for 1900-2100 in the LMRB, conditioned on large ensembles of a global climate model. We find a nonlinear increase in winter-spring flood hazard caused by sequential extreme storms under future climate conditions (SSP3-7.0 scenario). The annual exceedance probability of the official LMRB design flood is approximately 1/57,000 (95% CI: 1/15,000-1/680,000) under the current climate, which is projected to rise to 1/1,700 (95% CI: 1/900-1/3,600) in the middle of the century and to only 1/150 (95% CI: 1/90-1/260) by the century's end. We also find substantial increases in flood peak duration and total flood volume that have implications for dam and levee safety. The increased flood hazard is linked to an intensification of extreme storm sequences, characterized by increased storm frequency, higher precipitation intensity, greater storm area, and shorter intervals between storms. These findings provide insights into the potential impacts of climate change on future flood hazard in the Lower Mississippi River Basin. The approach used in this study demonstrates the value of utilizing information from large ensembles of global climate models for flood frequency analysis in a changing climate.
